# Inventory-Management-System
A simple command-line Inventory Management System built in Python. Features include adding, deleting, updating, searching, and displaying items with persistent storage using a text file. Developed as part of my SIWES attachment to practice Python fundamentals, file handling, exception handling, and modular programming.
